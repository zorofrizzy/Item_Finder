Radio communication protocol used to track objects within a 100m range from the master device.
Use the application ArduinoConnect as provided in the link below to operate the hardware : https://github.com/zorofrizzy/Arduino-Bluetooth-String/blob/master/ArduinoConnect(4).apk

BASICS:

1. A bluetooth app to connect the Master device to a smartphone.
2. The Master device has an nrf sensor attached that can communicate with upto 6 devices.
3. This prototype can communicate with upto two devices in a two way network.
4. The range of each module attached is 100m.
5. SPI protocols have been used for this.

Components Required : 
1. nRF sensors *3
2. Arduino (UNO/NANO) *3
3. Capacitors (100 uF / 25V) *3
4. HC05 (Bluetooth module) *1
5. PCB sheets as per requirement.
6. Battery to be connected to the modules.
7. Buzzers *2

Application :
1. To locate lost items.
2. Use the concept to parallel program horns to locate your vehicle in a parking lot.
3. Cargo tracking in a cargo shipment area
4. Live Wire detection by attaching a module to each live wire.
